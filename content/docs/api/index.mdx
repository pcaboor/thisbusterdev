API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a way for software to communicate with each other, much like a bridge that allows them to exchange information or perform actions for each other, without having to share all their code.

This is an example of a doc site built using [ContentLayer](/docs/documentation/contentlayer) and MDX.

## What is an API used for?

An `API` is used to:

1. Enable communication between two software programs: For example, a weather app on your phone uses an API to get weather data from a server.
2. Automate tasks: An API allows you to perform certain tasks automatically (send messages, retrieve information, make transactions, etc.).
3. Facilitate development: Instead of coding each feature from scratch, developers can use APIs to integrate existing features (like online payments or geolocation) into their applications.

## How does an API work?

To understand how an API works, let’s take a <span style={{ color: '#c472fb' }}>`restaurant analogy`</span>.


Imagine you’re in a restaurant. You’re the customer "like an app", and you want to order a dish.
The <span style={{ color: '#c472fb' }}>`menu`</span> represents what the restaurant offers, it’s like the <span style={{ color: '#c472fb' }}>`API Docs`</span> that describes what the API can do.
The <span style={{ color: '#c472fb' }}>`server`</span> acts as the API: it takes your order, passes it to the kitchen "the internal system", and then brings you your dish.

The API works in a similar way: it takes a request, passes it to another system, and then returns the response to the requester.

As you prefer we can show that like this :

| `Kitchen`                | `Client`       | `restaurant server`           | Docs |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ------------------ | --------------- |
| Database  | You        | API | Menu |

## Common Request Types in APIs

APIs use requests to request or send data. Here are some common request types:

- <span style={{ color: '#00ca50' }}>`GET`</span> : Retrieves data (e.g., getting a user's information).
- <span style={{ color: '#00cfb7' }}>`POST`</span> : Sends data to create something new (e.g., creating a new user account).
- <span style={{ color: '#ff990a' }}>`PUT`</span> : Modifies existing data (e.g., updating a user's profile).
- <span style={{ color: '#fc0135' }}>`DELETE`</span> : Deletes data (e.g., deleting a user account).


## Why are APIs useful?

`Efficiency` : APIs allow you to use features that have already been created and optimized.

`Time saving` : By using an API, developers can quickly integrate new features without having to recreate everything.

`Interoperability` : APIs allow software from different publishers to communicate and work together.

## Security and Authorization in APIs

APIs use methods to ensure that only authorized people or applications can access them. Here are some common security mechanisms:

`API Key` : An API key is a unique code that identifies and authorizes the user. It is like a password to access the API services.

`OAuth` : This is a security protocol that allows one application to access resources of another application (e.g., allowing an application to access your Facebook profile to log in) without sharing your password.

## The Importance of APIs in Modern Technology

`APIs` are essential in today’s technology world. They allow applications, services, and devices to communicate and work together. 

Without `APIs`, applications would be more isolated and less efficient. Whether it’s to retrieve data, create new features, or automate processes, 

`APIs` play a fundamental role in facilitating and accelerating the development of modern technology.

`Here is a simple example of an API` : 

Illustrated in several languages ​​to create, read, update and delete data. 

This example simulates a "task" management system (or "to-do list"), with the main operations `(CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete)`.

### API Structure

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
```

```js
let tasks = [];
```


`GET` /tasks: Retrieves the list of tasks.

```js
// GET /tasks
app.get('/tasks', (req, res) => {
  res.json(tasks);
});
```
`POST` /tasks: Creates a new task.

```js
// POST /tasks
app.post('/tasks', (req, res) => {
  const task = { id: tasks.length + 1, text: req.body.text };
  tasks.push(task);
  res.status(201).json(task);
});
```

`PUT` /tasks/ : Updates an existing task.
```js
// PUT /tasks/:id
app.put('/tasks/:id', (req, res) => {
  const task = tasks.find(t => t.id == req.params.id);
  if (task) {
    task.text = req.body.text;
    res.json(task);
  } else {
    res.status(404).send('Task not found');
  }
});
```

`DELETE` /tasks/ : Deletes an existing task.

```js
// DELETE /tasks/:id
app.delete('/tasks/:id', (req, res) => {
  const index = tasks.findIndex(t => t.id == req.params.id);
  if (index !== -1) {
    tasks.splice(index, 1);
    res.sendStatus(204);
  } else {
    res.status(404).send('task not found');
  }
});
```
```js
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server started on http://localhost:3000');
});
```
