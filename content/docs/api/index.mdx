API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a way for software to communicate with each other, much like a bridge that allows them to exchange information or perform actions for each other, without having to share all their code.

This is an example of a doc site built using [ContentLayer](/docs/documentation/contentlayer) and MDX.

## What is an API used for?

An `API` is used to:

1. Enable communication between two software programs: For example, a weather app on your phone uses an API to get weather data from a server.
2. Automate tasks: An API allows you to perform certain tasks automatically (send messages, retrieve information, make transactions, etc.).
3. Facilitate development: Instead of coding each feature from scratch, developers can use APIs to integrate existing features (like online payments or geolocation) into their applications.

## How does an API work?

To understand how an API works, let’s take a <span style={{ color: '#c472fb' }}>`restaurant analogy`</span>.


Imagine you’re in a restaurant. You’re the customer "like an app", and you want to order a dish.
The <span style={{ color: '#c472fb' }}>`menu`</span> represents what the restaurant offers, it’s like the <span style={{ color: '#c472fb' }}>`API Docs`</span> that describes what the API can do.
The <span style={{ color: '#c472fb' }}>`server`</span> acts as the API: it takes your order, passes it to the kitchen "the internal system", and then brings you your dish.

The API works in a similar way: it takes a request, passes it to another system, and then returns the response to the requester.

As you prefer we can show that like this :

| `Kitchen`                | `Client`       | `restaurant server`           | Docs |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ------------------ | --------------- |
| Database  | You        | API | Menu |

## Common Request Types in APIs

APIs use requests to request or send data. Here are some common request types:

- <span style={{ color: '#00ca50' }}>`GET`</span> : Retrieves data (e.g., getting a user's information).
- <span style={{ color: '#00cfb7' }}>`POST`</span> : Sends data to create something new (e.g., creating a new user account).
- <span style={{ color: '#ff990a' }}>`PUT`</span> : Modifies existing data (e.g., updating a user's profile).
- <span style={{ color: '#fc0135' }}>`DELETE`</span> : Deletes data (e.g., deleting a user account).
